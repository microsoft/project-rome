The full text of the MIT License follows:

The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever license you like.

SqlLite
-------------

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means. 

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
